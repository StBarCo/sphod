<h1>Loading the Database</h1>

<p>Loading the Database will allow this app to work offline.
For example, if you are flying or in a location where you can't get wifi
or a mobile phone signal (or maybe you don't want to use your mobile data). 
</p>
<p>It will also take up about 2Mb of data.</p>

<p>if the app is able to connect to the internet, it will use the ESV Bible
	for most readings. If you are offline or the ESV Bible is not available online
	(it happens), the app will use its backup translation - the World English Bible.
